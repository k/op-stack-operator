## ðŸ“¦ Project Purpose

This repository contains a **Kubernetes Operator** built with **Kubebuilder** to manage the lifecycle of an **OP Stack-based L2 rollup**. The operator introduces a single custom resource (`OPChain`) that declaratively deploys and manages all core components of an OP Stack chain:

- `op-geth`: execution client
- `op-node`: rollup coordination
- `op-batcher`: L2 â†’ L1 transaction data submission
- `op-proposer`: L2 output root checkpoint submission
- Optional: `proxyd`, monitoring, signer service

Architecture is defined in [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md)

Implementation plan is in [IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](mdc:IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)

Development progress is tracked in [PROGRESS.md](mdc:PROGRESS.md)
