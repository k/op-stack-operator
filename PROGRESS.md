# OP Stack Operator - Development Progress

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Initial Project Setup (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: January 17, 2025

### What's Done:

- **Kubebuilder Project**: Initialized with domain `optimism.io` and project version 3
- **CRDs Created**: All 5 core CRDs with controllers:
  - `OptimismNetwork` (foundational)
  - `OpNode`
  - `OpBatcher`
  - `OpProposer`
  - `OpChallenger`
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory layout with pkg/, examples/, docs/, helm/, test/ directories
- **Generated Assets**: CRD manifests, RBAC, sample configs, working Makefile
- **Verification**: Project builds successfully (`make build` passes)

### Key Files Created:

- `api/v1alpha1/*.go` - Type definitions for all CRDs
- `internal/controller/*.go` - Controller scaffolds for all CRDs
- `config/crd/bases/*.yaml` - Generated CRD manifests
- Complete Kubebuilder project structure

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Dependency Management (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed**: January 17, 2025

### What's Done:

- **Go Dependencies**: Added all required dependencies:
  - `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.15.11` - Ethereum client for L1/L2 interaction
  - `github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.22.0` - Metrics and monitoring
  - `github.com/stretchr/testify@latest` - Enhanced testing capabilities
  - Ginkgo/Gomega already present from Kubebuilder
- **Container Image Strategy**: Implemented comprehensive `pkg/config/images.go` with:
  - Default Optimism container images from official registry
  - Version compatibility matrix for stable components (all versions Docker-verified)
  - Image validation and override capabilities
  - Support for different version sets and caching policies
  - ‚úÖ All container images verified pullable from registry
- **Version Compatibility Matrix**: Established compatibility tracking between OP Stack components
- **Makefile Enhancements**: Added custom targets:
  - `make generate-all` - Generate all code and manifests
  - `make test-unit` and `make test-integration` - Granular testing
  - `make kind-load` - Load images into kind cluster
  - `make deploy-samples` - Deploy sample configurations
  - `make examples-basic` and `make examples-production` - Deploy examples
- **Build Verification**: Project builds successfully with new dependencies

### Key Files Created/Updated:

- `pkg/config/images.go` - Complete container image management system
- `Makefile` - Enhanced with development and testing targets
- `go.mod` - Updated with new dependencies

## üöß Phase 3: Core Implementation (NEXT)

### TODO:

- [ ] Implement comprehensive type definitions for all CRDs
- [ ] Develop core controller logic for OptimismNetwork (foundational)
- [ ] Implement OpNode controller with StatefulSet management
- [ ] Implement OpBatcher controller with Deployment management
- [ ] Implement OpProposer controller with Deployment management
- [ ] Implement OpChallenger controller with Deployment management
- [ ] Create shared packages for resource generation
- [ ] Implement contract address discovery service
- [ ] Add validation webhooks for CRDs

---

## üìã Remaining Phases:

- **Phase 4**: Testing Infrastructure
- **Phase 5**: Documentation and Examples
- **Phase 6**: CI/CD and Release

---

## üîß Development Environment:

- **Go Version**: 1.23+
- **Kubebuilder**: v4.0+
- **Test Cluster**: kind (for local testing)
- **Container Registry**: `us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images`

---

## üìù Notes:

- Using official Optimism container images (not Go imports due to monorepo complexity)
- Default OP Stack version: `v1.9.5`
- All CRDs use `optimism.optimism.io/v1alpha1` API group
- Project follows standard Kubebuilder patterns and best practices
