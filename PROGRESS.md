## 📝 Notes:

- **OptimismNetwork Foundation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Solid, refactored foundation with clean design
- **Design Improvements**: Successfully removed problematic `l2RpcUrl` and `l1RpcKind` fields
- **Simplified Architecture**: OptimismNetwork now focuses on what it should manage - L1 connectivity and shared config
- **Component-Specific L2 RPC**: Individual components will reference OpNode sequencers via `sequencerRef`
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests passing, integration test failures are infrastructure-related (not business logic)
- **Container Strategy**: Using official Optimism container images (not Go imports due to monorepo complexity)
- **Default OP Stack version**: `v1.13.3` with compatible op-geth `v1.101511.0`
- **API Group**: All CRDs use `optimism.optimism.io/v1alpha1`
- **Development Pattern**: Following standard Kubebuilder patterns and Kubernetes best practices
